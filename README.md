# Cloudflare Dynamic DNS Updater

## Overview

This ligthweight image runs a script that is designed to update DNS records on Cloudflare dynamically based on changes in your public IP address.
It's particularly useful for maintaining DNS records for services hosted at home or any environment with a dynamic IP address.

## Features

- **Dynamic IP Detection**: Automatically detects changes in the public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **Cloudflare API Integration**: Utilizes the Cloudflare API to update DNS records.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy-to-configure YAML file for the main config and JSON for specifying DNS records.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and debugging.

## Setup

For amd64 and arm64/aarch64:
1. Pull the image from Github:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/andriesmenze/cloudflare-ddns:latest
```
2. Start the container and mount the config an log folder to a docker volume or a folder on the host:
```bash
docker run \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/config \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/var/log/cloudflare-ddns \
--network host \
docker.io/library/cloudflare-ddns
```
3. Edit the cloudflare-ddns-config.yaml and dns-records.json file in the config folder and restart the container

For other architectures:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andriesmenze/Cloudflare-DDNS.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd cloudflare-dynamic-dns
```
3. Build the image:
```bash
docker buildx build -t cloudflare-ddns .
```
4. Start the container and mount the config an log folder to a docker volume or a folder on the host:
```bash
docker run \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/config \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/var/log/cloudflare-ddns \
--network host \
docker.io/library/cloudflare-ddns
```
5. Edit the cloudflare-ddns-config.yaml and dns-records.json file in the config folder and restart the container
