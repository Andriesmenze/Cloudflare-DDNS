# Cloudflare Dynamic DNS Updater

## Overview

This ligthweight image runs a script that is designed to update DNS records on Cloudflare dynamically based on changes in your public IP address.
It's particularly useful for maintaining DNS records for services hosted at home or any environment with a dynamic IP address.

## Features

- **Dynamic IP Detection**: Automatically detects changes in the public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **Cloudflare API Integration**: Utilizes the Cloudflare API to update DNS records.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy-to-configure YAML file for the main config and JSON for specifying DNS records.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and debugging.

## Setup

**For linux/amd64 and linux/arm64:**
1. Pull the image from Github:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/andriesmenze/cloudflare-ddns:latest
```
2. Start the container and mount the config an log folder to a docker volume or a folder on the host:
```bash
docker run \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/config \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/var/log/cloudflare-ddns \
--network host \
docker.io/library/cloudflare-ddns
```
3. Edit the cloudflare-ddns-config.yaml and dns-records.json file in the config folder and restart the container

**For other architectures:**
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andriesmenze/Cloudflare-DDNS.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd cloudflare-dynamic-dns
```
3. Build the image:
```bash
docker buildx build -t cloudflare-ddns .
```
4. Start the container and mount the config an log folder to a docker volume or a folder on the host:
```bash
docker run \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/config \
-v /your/path/or/volume:/var/log/cloudflare-ddns \
--network host \
docker.io/library/cloudflare-ddns
```
5. Edit the cloudflare-ddns-config.yaml and dns-records.json file in the config folder and restart the container

## Cloudflare DDNS Configuration (`cloudflare-ddns-config.yaml`)
```yaml
# File: cloudflare-ddns-config.yaml

# Cloudflare API Token
# For more information visit https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/
# Can also be set with the ENV Variable CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
API_TOKEN: "YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"

# Sleep Interval in seconds
# Can also be set with the ENV Variable SLEEP_INT
SLEEP_INTERVAL: 900 

# Log file location
# Can also be set with the ENV Variable LOG_FILE_LOCATION
LOG_FILE: "/var/log/cloudflare-ddns/update_dns.log"
```

## DNS Records Configuration (`dns-records.json`)

**zone_id**
zone identifier.
https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/

**record_type**
Record type.
Can be A for IPV4 or AAAA for IPV6.

**record_name**
DNS record name with a max of 255 character.

**subdomain**
The subdomain is the optional part of your domain that comes before the main domain.
If you're configuring a record for the main domain, you can leave this field empty

**proxied**
Whether the record is being proxied through cloudflare to receiving the performance and security benefits of Cloudflare.
Can be true or false.

**ttl**
Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds, When not specified it defaults to 1.
Setting to 1 means 'automatic'. Value must be between 60 and 86400, with the minimum reduced to 30 for Enterprise zones.

```json
{
  "ZONE_CONFIGS": [
    {
      "zone_id": "ZONE_ID_1",
      "record_type": "A",
      "record_name": "example.com",
      "subdomain": "",
      "proxied": "true",
      "ttl": "1"
    },
    {
      "zone_id": "ZONE_ID_2",
      "record_type": "AAAA",
      "record_name": "example.org",
      "subdomain": "",
      "proxied": "false",
      "ttl": "1"
    },
    {
      "zone_id": "ZONE_ID_2",
      "record_type": "AAAA",
      "record_name": "example.org",
      "subdomain": "www",
      "proxied": "true",
      "ttl": "1"
    }
  ]
